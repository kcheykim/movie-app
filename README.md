# Cheykim Portfolio

This is my most recent portfolio. In the top section which is the header, a list of navigational links will appear iwth the default 'About Me' in the center and a footer at the bottom. If the About me section is selected or defaulted to, you can view an image of me and a brief description of myself. When the Portfolio is selected, there will be a list of projects and assignments that showcase my work. I can be contact in the Contact section with a form but the best way to reach me through the email or GitHub icon. The Resume will display a button to download my resume and a list of some of the tools, languages, and packages that I have knowledge of as potential developer. Thank you for view my portfolio.
